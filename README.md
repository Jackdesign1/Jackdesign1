Hi there! I'm Zaky and I'm a backend developer at Nextstep a social media based project community.

I am a computer science student at Jember State Polytechnic.

Last but not least, I'm actively developing backend project for portofolio. I'm passionate about making the web a better place, and I'm always looking for new ways to do so. If you're interested in learning more about what I'm working on, don't hesitate to reach out!
